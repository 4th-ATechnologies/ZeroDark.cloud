	# In this project we're using it as a "Development Pod".

	# pod 'ZeroDarkCloud/Swift'
	#
	pod 'ZeroDarkCloud/Swift', path: '../../', :inhibit_warnings => false    

	# Used by sample application (not required for your application)

	pod 'CocoaLumberjack/Swift'
	pod 'KGHitTestingViews'
	pod 'ImageScrollView'
	pod 'SWRevealViewController'
	pod 'YapDatabase/SQLCipher'
	pod 'ZDCSyncable'
