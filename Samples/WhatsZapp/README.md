# WhatsZapp

A simple messaging app that demonstrates several features of the [ZeroDark.cloud](https://www.zerodark.cloud/) platform.



ZeroDark is unique in that it's a **zero-knowledge** system. As in, the messages you send/receive are encrypted end-to-end. So when Alice sends a message to Bob, only Alice & Bob are capable of reading the message. Nobody else. Not even the servers that handle storing and delivering the message.



## Getting Setup

Before you can build-and-run with Xcode, you'll need to install the dependencies using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/). Open your terminal, navigate to this directory, and then run the following command:

```
pod install
```



Within the code, nearly all ZeroDarkCloud integration is done within the ZDCManager.swift file.



## Overview

This is a sample app, written for the express purpose of teaching. You can think of it as a "chapter 1" exercise from a text book. It's not meant to demonstrate every possible feature â€” just the basics.

## The Basics

Cloud platforms come in all different shapes & sizes. Chances are you've used one before. And its certain that ZeroDark.cloud works differently. So let's start with a basic overview of how data is stored, structured & organized in the cloud.



ZeroDark.cloud provides every user with a [treesystem](https://zerodarkcloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client/tree/) in the cloud. Consider the following tree:

```
       (home)
       /    \
     (A)    (B)
    / | \    |
  (D)(E)(F) (G)
```



The term "treesystem" might be new, but the concept is simple. It's similar to a filesystem, but with one BIG difference:



##### Treesystem != Filesystem

A traditional filesystem has directories & files. This design forces all content to reside in the leaves. That is, if you think about a traditional filesystem as a tree, you can see that all files are leaves, and all non-leaves are directories.

In contrast, the ZeroDark.cloud treesystem acts as a generic tree, where each item in the tree is simply called a "node". A node can be whatever you want it to be - an object, a file, a container, etc. Additionally, **all nodes are allowed to have children**.



##### Treesystem = Hierarchial storage for your data

Look at the tree above, and think about the node (A). If this were a filesystem, then 'A' would have to be a directory. However, in a treesystem 'A' can be anything you want it to be. Perhaps 'A' is a Recipe object. And 'D', 'E' & 'F' are images of the recipe. Or perhaps 'A' is a Conversation object, and 'D', 'E', & 'F' are messages within the conversation. Or maybe 'A' is an Album, and 'D', 'E' & 'F' are songs in the album. You get the idea. 



So a treesystem allows you to store your data in the cloud in a hierarchial fashion. How you go about structuring the hierarchy is completely up to you, which means you can tailor it to meet the needs of your app.



More details about the treesystem can be found in the [docs](https://zerodarkcloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client/tree/).



## The WhatsZapp Treesystem

In order to store data in the ZeroDark cloud, all we have to do is come up with a treesystem design for our data. Every user gets their own treesystem, which comes with a "home" container, and some other special containers. Here's what it looks like:

```
       (alice's treesystem)
       /     /    \      \ 
      /     /      \      \
 (home) (prefs) (outbox) (inbox) 
```

(*These built-in containers are called "trunks".*)

The WhatsZapp treesystem only uses the 'home' & 'inbox' trunk, and is structured like this:

```
                (Alice's Treesystem)
                 /                 \
              (home)              (inbox)    
             /      \               /  \
     (convoBob)    (convoCarol)  (msg5)(msg6)
      /   |   \        |
(msg1)(msg2)(msg3)   (msg4)
                       |
                     (imgA)
```

To explain how everything works, let's start from the very beginning.



## Starting a conversation

Alice has just installed the app for the first time, and she doesn't have any content in her treesystem. She wants a send a message to Bob. Here's what she does. First, she creates a node for her conversation with Bob, and then she adds her outgoing message as a child node:

```
 (alice's treesystem)
       /    \
  (home)    (inbox)
    |
(convoBob)
    |
  (msg1)
```

When she uploads the message node, she instructs the server to copy the node into Bob's inbox:

```
 (alice's treesystem)           (bob's treesystem)
       /    \                      /         \
  (home)    (inbox)            (home)      (inbox)
    |                                         |
(convoBob)            ------------------>  (msg1)
    |                 | server-side-copy
  (msg1)---------------
```

Bob receives the message from Alice. The message then sits in his inbox until he reads it on one of this devices. Once the message has been read, he moves it into a conversation:

```
 (alice's treesystem)           (bob's treesystem)
       /    \                      /            \
  (home)    (inbox)            (home)        (inbox)
    |                             |
(convoBob)                  (convoAlice)
    |                             | 
  (msg1)                       (msg1)
```

If Bob responds to Alice, the reverse flow occurs:

```
 (alice's treesystem)           (bob's treesystem)
       /    \                      /            \
  (home)    (inbox)            (home)        (inbox)
    |          |                   |
(convoBob)  (msg2)<----      (convoAlice)
    |                 |          / \
  (msg1)              |------(msg2)(msg1)
```

## Designing for the cloud

When you design your treesystem, what you're doing is optimizing for the cloud. For example, imagine we didn't bother with conversation nodes. Every single message that Alice receives (whether from Bob, Carol or whoever), just sits in her inbox. But now fast-forward 12 months. Alice has 100,000 messages sitting in her inbox. And she just bought a new phone. Then she logs into your app on this brand new phone...

Leaving all messages in the inbox container means the app has to download all 100,000 messages. Without doing so, we can't be sure who Alice has conversations with. Now contrast that with our optimized design above.

It's easy for our app to quickly see who Alice has conversations with. All we have to do is download the conversation nodes. (And any pending messages in her inbox.)

Further, we can optimize our app. Alice might have 250,000 messages with her spouse. But there's no need to download them all. We can download only the most recent messages within each conversation. (And download older conversations on demand, if she scrolls back that far.)



When you design the treesystem for your app, think about long-time users of your app. Imagine them upgrading their phone, and then logging into your app on their new phone. How can you exploit the treesystem to minimize the amount of information you must download? How can you make your app quickly restore its previous state?



## Code Structure

**ZDCManager.swift**

This is where the majority of the sample code is. This class implements the ZeroDarkCloudDelegate protocol. Thus it:

- provides the data to be uploaded to the cloud
- reacts to callbacks from ZDC when it has discovered changes in the cloud



**ConversationsViewController.swift**

This is the user interface that displays the TableView of all conversations.



**MyMessagesViewController.swift**

This is the user interface that displays the CollectionView of messages within a conversation. We're using the open-source MessageKit, so there's a minimal amount of work we have to do here.



**DBManager.swift**

Here we setup our database to index stuff for our user interface. In particular, we store 2 different kinds of objects:

- Conversation
- Message

So we setup indexes that:

- sort conversations based on most recent message
- sort messages within each conversation based on timestamp
