/**
 * This class represents the decrypted information within a RCRD file.
 *
 * Every node that gets stored in the cloud gets split into 2 files:
 * - the RCRD file contains the filesystem metadata (name of file, permissions, etc)
 * - the DATA file contains the actual content of the node
 *
 * ZeroDark.cloud downloads RCRD files automatically (which are small),
 * in order to keep the local treesystem up-to-date with the cloud.
 * Note, however, that it does NOT automatically download DATA files.
 * Your application gets to decide which DATA files to download & when.
